# Employee Management System

This is an **Employee Management System** built using **ASP.NET Core Razor Pages**, **Entity Framework Core**, and **SQL Server** for data persistence. The application allows the management of employee data, including **Employee CRUD operations**, **Department Management**, and **Performance Reviews**.

The architecture follows **Clean Architecture** principles and uses **Stored Procedures (SP)** for performance optimization, especially for large datasets.

## Technologies Used

- **ASP.NET Core**: Web framework used to build the web application.
- **Entity Framework Core**: ORM used to interact with the SQL Server database.
- **SQL Server**: Used as the database for storing employee and department data.
- **Razor Pages**: Used for frontend view rendering and handling user input.
- **Bootstrap**: Used for styling and layout.
- **Stored Procedures (SP)**: Optimized for handling large datasets and performance-heavy queries.

## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up and run the **Employee Management System** locally:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/EmployeeManagementSystem.git
cd EmployeeManagementSystem
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Ensure you have **.NET 6** or later installed on your machine. You can download it from the [official Microsoft site](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).

Run the following command to restore the NuGet packages:

```bash
dotnet restore
```

### 3. Set up the Database

- Create a database in SQL Server (e.g., `Employee_Management_System`).
- Configure the **`appsettings.json`** file with your database connection string. Example:

```json
"ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Server=DESKTOP-6H5N4SN\\SQLEXPRESS;Database=Employee_Management_System;Trusted_Connection=True;"
}
```

### 4. Apply Migrations and run Store proecedure

Run the following command to apply the migrations and create the database schema:

```bash
dotnet ef database update
```
The MySQL stored procedures (SP) are included in the domain file and can be executed directly within Visual Studio using its built-in functionality

### 5. Run the Application

To run the application, use the following command:

```bash
dotnet run
```

After the application is running, you can access it at `https://localhost:5001` (or the port specified in your terminal).

## Project Overview and Features

This project includes the following key features:

### 1. **Employee Management**
   - **Add** new employees.
   - **Edit** employee details.
   - **Delete** employees.
   - **View** a list of all employees.
   - Employees are associated with **Departments** and **Performance Reviews**.

### 2. **Department Management**
   - Manage **Departments** in the organization.
   - View **Department** details.
   - Assign **employees** to departments.

### 3. **Performance Reviews**
   - Assign and view **Performance Reviews** for each employee.
   - **Rating system** for employees to track their performance.
   - View performance across **departments**.

### 4. **Employee Deletion**
   - **Delete** an employee.
   - Delete operations are optimized using **Stored Procedures**.

### 5. **Employee List**
   - View the list of employees with associated **Department** and **Performance Review**.

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can:

- **Add a new employee**: Go to the "Add Employee" page, fill in the details, and submit the form.
- **View all employees**: The "Employee List" page will show all employees along with their details and the department they belong to.
- **Edit an employee**: You can edit the details of any employee by clicking the "Edit" button next to their name.
- **Delete an employee**: You can delete an employee by clicking the "Delete" button next to their name.
- **Department Management**: You can manage the departments in the organization and assign employees to departments.

## Performance Optimization

To handle **large datasets** efficiently, weâ€™ve implemented **Stored Procedures (SP)** to optimize performance in the following areas:

- **Employee Deletion**: Deleting large numbers of employees is handled by a stored procedure to avoid performance degradation.
- **Department List**: Loading department-related data is optimized with a stored procedure that fetches employee counts and department details efficiently.
- **Performance Reviews**: Fetching performance data for large organizations is optimized by running SPs to retrieve data in a single optimized query.

These stored procedures ensure faster performance, even with large data volumes.
