##Employee Management System
This is an Employee Management System built using ASP.NET Core Razor Pages and Entity Framework Core with SQL Server for data persistence. The application allows the management of employee data, including creating, reading, updating, and deleting employees, as well as associating employees with departments.

Technologies Used
ASP.NET Core: Web framework used to build the web application.
Entity Framework Core: ORM used to interact with the SQL Server database.
SQL Server: Used as the database for storing employee and department data.
Razor Pages: Used for the frontend view rendering and handling user input.
Bootstrap: Used for styling and layout.
Setup Instructions
Follow these steps to set up and run the Employee Management System locally:

1. Clone the Repository
bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/EmployeeManagementSystem.git
cd EmployeeManagementSystem
2. Install Dependencies
Ensure you have .NET 6 or later installed on your machine. You can download it from the official Microsoft site.

Run the following command to restore the NuGet packages:

bash
Copy
dotnet restore
3. Set up the Database
Create a database in SQL Server (e.g., Employee_Management_System).
Configure the appsettings.json file with your database connection string. Example:
json
Copy
"ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Server=DESKTOP-6H5N4SN\\SQLEXPRESS;Database=Employee_Management_System;Trusted_Connection=True;"
}
4. Apply Migrations
Run the following command to apply the migrations and create the database schema:

bash
Copy
dotnet ef database update
5. Run the Application
To run the application, use the following command:

bash
Copy
dotnet run
After the application is running, you can access it at https://localhost:5001 (or the port specified in your terminal).

Usage
Once the application is running, you can:

Add a new employee: Go to the "Add Employee" page, fill in the details, and submit the form.
View all employees: The "Employee List" page will show all employees along with their details and the department they belong to.
Edit an employee: You can edit the details of any employee by clicking the "Edit" button next to their name.
Delete an employee: You can delete an employee by clicking the "Delete" button next to their name.

It looks like you've uploaded new screenshots showing the Solution Explorer of your project, which includes various folders for Domain, Pages, and Managers, among other files.

Based on the new structure:
Domain contains models and data transfer objects (DTOs) like DepartmentManagementDTO.cs, Employee.cs, PerformanceReviewDTO.cs, etc.
Pages contains Razor Pages like EmployeeAdd.cshtml, EmployeeList.cshtml, PerformanceReviewList.cshtml, etc.
Managers includes manager classes such as EmployeeManager.cs, DepartmentManager.cs, BaseManager.cs, and their corresponding interfaces.
What to Do Next:
Domain Models (DTOs): It looks like you are using DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) like DepartmentManagementDTO.cs and EmployeeInformationDTO.cs. You will need to use these DTOs for transferring data between layers (like from the controller to the views).

Employee Manager: You already have an EmployeeManager class, which likely handles CRUD operations for the Employee model. The manager classes are used to abstract the logic of interacting with the database.

Razor Pages: It looks like your Employee CRUD operations are handled via Razor Pages, such as EmployeeAdd.cshtml, EmployeeDelete.cshtml, and EmployeeList.cshtml. These pages provide the UI for performing actions on employees.

Possible Next Steps:
Update DTOs for Employees and Departments: If you're using DTOs, make sure to map the Employee and Department models to DTOs before sending data to the Razor Pages or the client-side. You might use AutoMapper for mapping if your application has complex object relationships.

Check Your Manager Logic: Ensure that your manager classes (like EmployeeManager, DepartmentManager, etc.) are performing the necessary CRUD operations and interacting with Entity Framework via the DbContext.

Review Razor Pages: Look through the Razor Pages for Employee CRUD operations. Make sure the forms are correctly handling the employee's data and interacting with the backend via the manager classes.
